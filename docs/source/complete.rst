Complete sampling
=================

The sequential structure of LAIS methodology requires running the ``lower_layer`` after the ``upper_layer``.
Additionally, the complete algorithm is not finished until the Importance Sampling samples generated by the ``lower_layer``
are obtained. The whole sampling procedure can be called in just one command by using the ``main`` method:

.. automethod:: pylais.Lais.main
 

See :ref:`Partial posteriors <target>` example for a demonstration of its use.
 
..  method which takes as inputs the arguments of both \verb|upper_layer| and \verb|lower_layer| and return the weighted IS samples.
